# Assignment 2
This is an assignment for my Systems Security and Malicious Code course. 
I exploited ARM and X86 using buffer overflow vulnerabilities to execute shellcode. 

## Locations of files
* *files* 

  This directory contains exploit scripts - ```exploit.py``` for each part where applicable

  input files to the binaries are located in the ```tmp``` subdirectory of each part.

  For example, ```files/part2/arm/tmp/exp``` would be the input file for the part2 ARM exercise.

* *submission*
  
  This directory contains submission files used

* *submission.md*
  
  My solutions for each exercise with input explanations and the hashes obtained

* *Assignment 2 Writeup*
  
  A detailed writeup that explains each exercise step by step. 

  Note that the naming convention for the files in the writeup is slightly different.
  ```/tmp/anmol.py``` and ```/tmp/anmol-p3.py``` on the server correspond to ```exploit.py``` which is provided in the repository.
  ```/tmp/anmol``` and ```/tmp/anmol-p3``` on the server correspond to ```tmp/exp``` which is provided in the repository.
